OSVR-data is an external for the Pure Data patching language.
It can receive the positional and rotational data from the OSVR headset via the osvr-server and provides it in a patch, for example to move inside a VR environment created with GEM.
It is coded by IOhannes zm√∂lning and licensed under LGPL.

For this external to work, the libosvrRenderManager.so must be accessible for loading. The directory needs to be declared when launching Pd like so:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dist/lib pd
